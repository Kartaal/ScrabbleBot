# ScrabbleBot

The bot probably does not work as it connects to a server which has likely been taken offline. This project was part of a course and so the lifetime of the server was similarly short.

It is worth noting that the bot can only play a word on an empty board as there wasn't time and energy during the project for a more complete bot.
